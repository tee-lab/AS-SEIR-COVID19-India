# AS-SEIR-COVID19-India
Age structured SEIR model for India and three of its states. Generates R ShinyApp which can be found [here](https://guttal.shinyapps.io/seir-agestr-covid/).

## Summary
This code implements an R ShinyApp which can be found at (add link). Here, you can view graphs that intuitively capture the spread of the coronavirus pandemic in India, and more locally, in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. We use an age-structured SEIR model with two age-groups, respectively those below and above 60 years of age. This is **not** a model intended for forecasting! Use this model just to qualitatively interpret the effects of various interventions.

## Authors
This small project was coded by [Pranav Minasandra](https://pminasandra.weeby.com) in collaboration with Vishwesha Guttal from the Centre for Ecological Sciences. `R` is not Pranav's first language, so he requests that he be pardoned for the mildly shoddy code.
